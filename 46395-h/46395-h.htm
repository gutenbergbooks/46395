<h2>A VOICE FROM "THE UPPER SUCKLES."</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">My Good Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;I notice that in spite of all London being
out of town, a number of persons have been holding, or propose
holding, a meeting condemnatory of the House of Lords. I fancy,
regardless of the close of the season, the site chosen has been or
will be Hyde Park. Perhaps, under these circumstances, you, as the
representative of the nation&mdash;equally of the aristocracy and the
democracy&mdash;will allow me a few lines' space in which to express
my sentiments.</p>

<p>My good Sir, I am considerably past middle age, and yet, man and boy,
have been in the House of Peers quite half-a-dozen years. I cannot
say that I was added to the number of my colleagues because I was an
eminent lawyer, or a successful general, or a great statesman. I
believe my claim to the distinction that was conferred upon
me,&mdash;now many summers since,&mdash;was the very considerable
services I was able to afford that most useful industry the paper
decoration of what may be aptly termed "the wooden walls of London."
When called upon to select an appropriate territorial title, I
selected, without hesitation, the Barony of Savon de Soapleigh. Savon
is a word of French extraction, and denotes the Norman origin of my
illustrious race. Not only was I able to assist at the regeneration
of the "great unwashed," but also to do considerable service to the
grand cause with which my party in politics is honourably associated.
I was able to contribute a very large sum to the election purse, and
having fought and lost several important constituencies, was amply
rewarded by the coronet that becomes me so well, the more especially
when displayed upon the panels of my carriage.</p>

<p>You will ask me, no doubt (for this is an age of questions), what I
have done since I entered the Upper Chamber? I will reply that I have
secured a page in <i>Burke</i>, abstained from voting, except to oblige
the party whips, and, before all and above all, pleased my lady wife.
And yet there are those who would wish to abolish the House of Peers!
There are those who would do away with our ancient nobility! Perish
the thought! for in the House of Peers I see the reflection of the
nation's greatness.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
  <a href="images/085b.png">
  <img src="images/085b.png"
  alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>But you may ask me, "Would I do anything to improve that Chamber?"
And I would answer, "Yes." I would say, "Do not increase its numbers;
it is already large enough."</p>

<p>It is common knowledge that a gentleman of semi-medicinal reputation,
who has been as beneficial, or nearly as beneficial, to the
proprietors of hoardings as myself, wishes to be created Viscount
Cough of Mixture. Yet another of the same class desires to be known
to generations yet unborn as Lord Tobacco of Cigarettes; whilst a
third, on account of the attention he has paid to the
"understandings" (pardon the <i>plaisanterie</i>) of the people, is
anxious to figure on the roll of honour as "Baron de Boots."</p>

<p>My good <i>Mr. Punch</i>, such an extension of the House of Peers merely
for the satisfaction of the vanity of a number of vulgar and puffing
men would be a scandal to our civilisation. No, my good Sir, our
noble order is large enough. I am satisfied that it should not be
extended, and when I am satisfied the opinions of every one else are
(and here I take a simile from an industry that has given me my
wealth) "merely bubbles&mdash;bubbles of soap."</p>

<p>And now I sign myself, not as of old, plain
<span class="smcap">Joe Snooks</span>, but Yours very faithfully,</p>

<p class="author smcap">Savon de Soapleigh.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I am sure my long line of ancestors
would agree with me. When that long line
is discovered you shall hear the result.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>A Story in Scenes.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">PART VIII.&mdash;SURPRISES&mdash;AGREEABLE AND OTHERWISE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene XIII.</span>&mdash;<i>The Amber Boudoir.</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span> <i>has just entered.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Ha, <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>, my dear, glad to see you. Well, <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span>,
how are you, eh? You're <i>looking</i> uncommonly well! No
idea you were here!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell (to himself).</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>! He'll have me out of this
pretty soon, I expect!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire (aggrieved).</i> We have been in the house for the best
part of an hour, <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>&mdash;as you might have discovered by inquiring&mdash;but
no doubt you preferred your comfort to welcoming a guest
who was merely your sister!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup. (to himself).</i> Beginning already! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Very
sorry&mdash;got rather wet riding&mdash;had to change everything. And I
knew <span class="smcap">Albinia</span> was here.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant. (magnanimously).</i> Well, we won't begin to quarrel
the moment we meet; and you are forgetting your other guest.
(<i>In an undertone.</i>) Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>&mdash;the Poet&mdash;wrote <i>Andromeda</i>.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, come and let me present
you to my brother.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Ah, how d'ye do? (<i>To himself, as he
shakes hands.</i>) What the deuce am I to say to this
fellow? (<i>Aloud.</i>) Glad to see you here, Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>&mdash;heard
all about you&mdash;<i>Andromeda</i>, eh? Hope
you'll manage to amuse yourself while you're with
us; afraid there's not much you can do <i>now</i> though.</p>

<p><i>Spurr. (to himself).</i> Horse in a bad way; time
they let me see it. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Well, we must see,
Sir; I'll do all <i>I</i> can.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> You see, the shooting's <i>done</i> now.</p>

<p><i>Spurr. (to himself, professionally piqued).</i> They
might have waited till I'd seen the horse before they
shot him! After calling me in like this! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>. I wish I
could have got here earlier, I'm sure.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Wish we'd asked you a month ago, if
you're fond of shooting. Thought you might look
down on Sport, perhaps.</p>

<p><i>Spurr. (to himself).</i> Sport? Why, he's talking of
<i>birds</i>&mdash;not the horse! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Me, Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>?
Not <i>much</i>! I'm as keen on a day's gunning as any
man, though I don't often get the chance now.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup. (to himself, pleased).</i> Come, he don't seem
strong against the Game Laws! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Thought
you didn't look as if you sat over your desk all day!
There's hunting still, of course. Don't know whether
you ride?</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Rather so, Sir! Why, I was born and
bred in a sporting county, and as long as my old
uncle was alive, I could go down to his farm and get
a run with the hounds now and again.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup. (delighted).</i> Capital! Well, our next
meet is on Tuesday&mdash;best part of the country; nearly
all grass, and nice clean post and rails. You must
stay over for it. Got a mare that will carry your
weight perfectly, and I think I can promise you a
run&mdash;eh, what do you say?</p>

<p><i>Spurr. (to himself, in surprise).</i> He <i>is</i> a chummy
old cock! I'll wire old <span class="smcap">Spavin</span> that I'm detained on biz; and I'll
tell 'em to send my riding-breeches down! (<i>Aloud.</i>) It's uncommonly
kind of you, Sir, and I think I can manage to stop on a bit.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin (to herself).</i> <span class="smcap">Rupert</span> must be out of his senses! It's
bad enough to have him here till Monday! (<i>Aloud.</i>) We mustn't
forget, <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>, how valuable Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell's</span> time is; it would
be too selfish of us to detain him here a day longer than&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> My dear, Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> has already said he can
<i>manage</i> it; so we may all enjoy his society with a clear conscience.
(Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span> <i>conceals her sentiments with difficulty.</i>) And now,
<span class="smcap">Albinia</span>, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to my room and rest
a little, as I'm rather fatigued, and you have all these tiresome
people coming to dinner to-night.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She rises, and leaves the room; the other ladies follow her
example.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>, I'm going up now with <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span>. You
know where we've put Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, don't you? The Verney
Chamber.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She goes out.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Take you up now, if you like, Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>&mdash;it's only
just seven, though. Suppose you don't take an hour to dress, eh?</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Oh dear no, Sir, nothing like it! (<i>To himself.</i>) Won't
take me two minutes as I am now! I'd better tell him&mdash;I can say
my bag hasn't come. I don't believe it <i>has</i>, and, any way, it's a good
excuse. (<i>Aloud.</i>) The&mdash;the fact is, Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>, I'm afraid that
my luggage has been unfortunately left behind.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> No luggage, eh? Well, well, it's of no consequence.
But I'll ask about it&mdash;I daresay it's all right.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He goes out.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>). Sure to have turned up, you
know&mdash;man will have seen to that. Shouldn't altogether object to a
glass of sherry and bitters before dinner. Don't know how <i>you</i> feel&mdash;suppose
you've a soul <i>above</i> sherry and bitters, though?</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Not at this moment. But I'd soon <i>put</i> my soul above a
sherry and bitters if I got a chance!</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick. (after reflection).</i> I say, you know, that's rather
smart, eh? (<i>To himself.</i>) Aw'fly clever sort of chap, this, but not
stuck up&mdash;not half a bad sort, if he <i>is</i> a bit of a bounder. (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Anythin' in the evenin' paper? Don't get 'em down here.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Nothing much. I see there's an objection to <i>Monkey-tricks</i>
for the Grand National.</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick. (interested).</i> No, by Jove! Hope they won't carry it&mdash;meant
to have something on him.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> I wouldn't back him myself. I know something that's
safe to win, bar accidents&mdash;a dead cert, Sir! Got the tip straight
from the stables. You just take my advice, and pile all you can on
<i>Jumping Joan</i>.</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick. (later, to himself, after a long and highly interesting
conversation).</i> Thunderin' clever chap&mdash;never knew
poets <i>were</i> such clever chaps. Might be a "bookie,"
by Gad! No wonder <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> thinks such a lot of
him!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He sighs.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir Rup. (returning).</i> Now, Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, if
you'll come upstairs with me, I'll show you your
quarters. By the way, I've made inquiries about
your luggage, and I think you'll find it's all right.
(<i>As he leads the way up the staircase.</i>) Rather
awkward for you if you'd had to come down to
dinner just as you are, eh?</p>

<p><i>Spurr. (to himself).</i> Oh, lor, my beastly bag <i>has</i>
come after all! Now they'll <i>know</i> I didn't bring a
dress suit. What an owl I was to tell him! (<i>Aloud,
feebly.</i>) Oh&mdash;er&mdash;very awkward indeed, Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup. (stopping at a bedroom door).</i> Verney
Chamber&mdash;here you are. Ah, my wife forgot to have
your name put up on the door&mdash;better do it now, eh?
(<i>He writes it on the card in the door-plate.</i>) There&mdash;well,
hope you'll find it all comfortable&mdash;we dine
at eight, you know. You've plenty of time for all
you've got to do!</p>

<p><i>Spurr. (to himself).</i> If I only knew <i>what</i> to do! I
shall never have the cheek to come down as I am!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He enters the Verney Chamber dejectedly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene XIV.</span>&mdash;<i>An Upper Corridor in the East Wing.</i></p>

<p><i>Steward's Room Boy</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>). This is your
room, Sir&mdash;you'll find a fire lit and all.</p>

<p><i>Undershell (scathingly).</i> A fire? For me! I scarcely
expected such an indulgence. You are <i>sure</i> there's
no mistake?</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> This is the room I was told, Sir. You'll find
candles on the mantelpiece, and matches.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> Every luxury indeed! I am pampered&mdash;<i>pampered</i>!</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Yes, Sir. And I was to say as supper's at
ar-past nine, but Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pomfret</span> would be 'appy to see
you in the Pugs' Parlour whenever you pleased to
come down and set there.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> The Pugs' Parlour?</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> What we call the 'Ousekeeper's Room, among ourselves, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pomfret</span> does me too much honour. And shall I have
the satisfaction of seeing your intelligent countenance at the festive
board, my lad?</p>

<p><i>Boy (giggling).</i> Lor, Sir, I don't set down to meals along with the
<i>upper</i> servants, Sir!</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> And I&mdash;a mere man of genius&mdash;<i>do</i>! These distinctions must
strike you as most arbitrary; but restrain any natural envy, my
young friend. I assure you I am not puffed up by this promotion!</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> No, sir. (<i>To himself, as he goes out.</i>) I believe he's a bit
dotty, I do. I don't understand a word he's been talking of!</p>

<p><i>Und. (alone, surveying the surroundings).</i> A cockloft, with a
painted iron bedstead, a smoky chimney, no bell, and a text over
the mantelpiece! Thank Heaven, that fellow <span class="smcap">Drysdale</span> can't see
me here! But I will not sleep in this place, my pride will only just
bear the strain of staying to supper&mdash;no more. And I'm hanged if I
go down to the Housekeeper's Room till hunger drives me. It's not
eight yet&mdash;how shall I pass the time? Ha, I see they've favoured me
with pen and ink. I will invoke the Muse. Indignation should
make verses, as it did for <span class="smcap">Juvenal</span>; and <i>he</i> was never set down to
sup with slaves!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He writes.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene XV.</span>&mdash;<i>The Verney Chamber.</i></p>

<p><i>Spurr. (to himself).</i> My word, what a room! Carpet all over the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
walls, big fourposter, carved ceiling, great fireplace with blazing
logs,&mdash;if this is how they do a <i>vet</i> here, what price the <i>other</i> fellows'
rooms? And to think I shall have to do without dinner, just when I
was getting on with 'em all so swimmingly! I <i>must</i>. I can't, for
the credit of the profession&mdash;to say nothing of the firm&mdash;turn up in a
monkey jacket and tweed bags, and that's all <i>I</i>'ve got except a
nightgown!... It's all very well for Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> to say "Take
everything as it comes," but if she was in <i>my</i> fix!... And it
isn't as if I hadn't <i>got</i> dress things either. If only I'd brought 'em
down, I'd have marched in to dinner as cool as a&mdash;&mdash;(<i>he lights a pair
of candles.</i>) Hullo! What's that on the bed? (<i>He approaches it.</i>)
Shirt! white tie! socks! coat, waistcoat, trousers&mdash;they <i>are</i> dress
clothes!... And here's a pair of brushes on the table! I'll swear
they're not <i>mine</i>&mdash;there's a monogram on them&mdash;"U.G." What does
it all mean? Why, of course! regular old trump, Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>, and
naturally he wants me to do him credit. He saw how it was, and he's
gone and rigged me out! In a house like this, they're ready for
emergencies&mdash;keep all sizes in stock, I daresay.... It isn't "U. G."
on the brushes&mdash;it's "G. U."&mdash;"Guest's Use." Well, this is what I
call doing the thing in style! <i>Cinderella</i>'s nothing to it! Only hope
they're a decent fit. (<i>Later, as he dresses.</i>) Come, the shirt's all
right; trousers a trifle short&mdash;but they'll let down; waistcoat&mdash;whew,
must undo the buckle&mdash;hang it, it <i>is</i> undone! I feel like a hooped
barrel in it! Now the coat&mdash;easy does it. Well, it's <i>on</i>; but I shall
have to be peeled like a walnut to get it off again.... Shoes? ah,
here they are&mdash;pair of pumps. Phew&mdash;must have come from the
Torture Exhibition in Leicester Square; glass slippers nothing to
'em! But they'll have to do at a pinch; and they <i>do</i> pinch like
blazes! Ha, ha, that's good! I must tell that to the Captain. (<i>He
looks at himself in a mirror.</i>) Well, I can't say they're up to mine
for cut and general style; but they're passable. And now I'll go
down to the Drawing Room and get on terms with all the smarties!</p>

<h2>SOCIETY FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF LITERATURE</h2>

<div class="figleft w25">
  <a href="images/089a.png">
  <img src="images/089a.png"
  alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>The first annual meeting of this society, which, as our readers will
remember, has been in process of formation for some years past, was
held yesterday. We cannot congratulate the society on its decision to
exclude reporters. It is true that our representative, on seeking
admission, was informed that his presence would be unnecessary, as
members of the society, having for some time past done their own
reviewing, intended for the future to report themselves. The public,
however, whose eager interest in literature is sufficiently attested
not only by the literary page of democratic newspapers, but by the
columns which even reactionary journals devote to higher criticism
and literary snippets&mdash;the public, we say, will not brook this
absurd plea, and will refuse to accept any but an impartial report of
a gathering such as was held yesterday. This we have obtained, and we
now proceed to publish it for the benefit of the world.</p>

<p>The meeting opened with a prayer of two thousand words specially
written for the occasion by Mr. <span class="smcap">Richard L- G-lli-nne</span> in collaboration
with Mr. <span class="smcap">Robert B-ch-n-n</span>. As this is shortly to be published
in the form of a joint letter to the <i>Daily Chronicle</i> it is only
necessary to say at present that it combines vigour of expression
with delicacy of sentiment and grace of style in the very highest
degree. By the way, we may mention that the new Prayer-book of
the Society is to be published by Messrs. <span class="smcap">E-k-n m-tth-ws</span> and <span class="smcap">J-hn
L-ne</span>, at the "Bodley Head," before the end of the year. It will be
profusely illustrated by MESSRS. <span class="smcap">A-br-y B-ard-l-y</span> and <span class="smcap">W-lt-r
S-ck-rt</span>, who have also designed for it a special fancy cover. Only
three hundred copies will be issued. To return, however, to the
meeting.</p>

<p>After harmony had been restored, Mr. <span class="smcap">W-lt-r B-s-nt</span> asked leave
to say a few words. His remarks, in which he was understood to
advocate the compulsory expropriation of publishers, were at first
listened to with favour. Happening incautiously to say a word or
two in praise of a Mr. <span class="smcap">Dickens</span> and a Mr. <span class="smcap">Thackeray</span> he was groaned
down after a sturdy struggle. Mr. <span class="smcap">Dickens</span> and Mr. <span class="smcap">Thackeray</span>
were not, we understand, present in the room at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">H-b-rt Cr-ck-nth-rpe</span> rose and denounced the previous
speaker. Literature, he declared, must be vague. What was the
use of knowing what you were driving at? What was the use of
anyone knowing anything? Personally he didn't mean to know
more than he could help, and he could assure the meeting that he
could help a great deal; yes, he could help his fellow-creatures to a
right understanding of the value of patchwork and jerks. That was
the religion of humanity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">N-rm-n G-le</span> said he wasn't much good speaking, but he
could do something in the dairy and orchard style. He then gave
the following example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i0">Enter <span class="smcap">Celia</span>, robed in white,<br /></span>
      <span class="i2"><span class="smcap">Celia's</span> been a-milking.<br /></span>
      <span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Celia</span> daily doth indite<br /></span>
      <span class="i2">Praises to the Pill-king.<br /></span>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Celia's</span> flocks and <span class="smcap">Celia's</span> herds<br /></span>
      <span class="i2">(Only she can teach 'em)<br /></span>
      <span class="i0">All produce their cream and curds,<br /></span>
      <span class="i2">Helped by Mr. <span class="smcap">B-ch-m</span>.<br /></span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A loud cheer greeted the recital of this charming pastoral, and one
editor, who is not often a victim to mere sentiment, said it reminded
him of his happy childhood, when he used to take Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory's</span>
powders after a day spent in the neighbouring farmer's orchard.</p>

<p>The next speaker was <span class="smcap">G-orge Eg-rt-n</span>. All women, she said,
must be <span class="smcap">Georges</span>. <span class="smcap">George Sand</span> and <span class="smcap">George Eliot</span> were women
she believed. <span class="smcap">George Meredith</span> was an exception, but that only
proved her rule. Women were a miserable lot: it was their own
fault. Why marry? ("Hear, hear," from Mrs. <span class="smcap">Mona Caird</span>.) Why
be born at all? She paused for a reply.</p>

<p>At this point Mr. <span class="smcap">W. T. St-ad</span> entered the room and offered to talk
about "<span class="smcap">Julia</span> in Chicago," but the meeting broke up in confusion,
without the customary vote of thanks to the Chair.</p>

<h2>HOW IT WILL BE DONE HEREAFTER.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>A Serene Ducal Romance of the Future.</i>)</p>

<p>His Highness was smoking a pipe at the close of the day in the fair
realm of Utopia. He had finished dinner, and was discussing his
<i>lager</i> beer, which had quite taken the place of coffee.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said the Duke, rather anxiously, as he noticed the Premier
was seating himself in a chair in his near neighbourhood; "I am
afraid I am in disgrace."</p>

<p>"Not at all, Sir," replied the Minister, graciously. "On the
contrary, in the name of the people of Utopia, I beg to offer you my
sincere thanks."</p>

<p>"For what?" queried the Duke.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
  <a href="images/089b.png">
  <img src="images/089b.png"
  alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"For doing your duty, my liege. Not that that is a novelty, for,
as a matter of fact, you are always doing it."</p>

<p>"I am pleased to hear you say so," observed His Highness; "as I
was under the impression that I had rather shirked my engagements."</p>

<p>"Not at all, Sir&mdash;not at all. If you consult your memory, you
will find you carried out to-day's programme to the letter."</p>

<p>"Had I not to lay a foundation stone, or something, this morning?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly; and you touched a cord as you were getting up, and
immediately the machinery was set in motion, and the stone was duly
laid. Much better than driving miles to have to stand in a drafty
marquee."</p>

<p>"And had I not to open an exhibition?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. And you opened it in due course. Your equerry represented
you and ground out your speech from the portable phonograph."</p>

<p>"Well, really, that was very ingenious," remarked His Highness.
"But was I not missed?"</p>

<p>"You would have been, Sir," returned the Premier, "had we not
had the forethought to send down the lantern that gives you in a
thousand different attitudes. By revolving the disc rapidly the
most life-like presentment was offered immediately."</p>

<p>"Excellent! and did I do anything else?"</p>

<p>"Why your Highness has been hard at work all day attending
reviews, opening canals, and even presiding at public dinners.
Thanks to science we can reproduce your person, your speech, your
very presence at a moment's notice."</p>

<p>"Exceedingly clever!" exclaimed His Highness. "Ah, how much
better is the twentieth century than its predecessor!"</p>

<p>And no doubt the sentiment of His Highness will be approved by
posterity.

<h2>COUNTING THE CATCH.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>A Waltonian Fragment.</i></p>

<p><i>First Piscator</i>, <span class="smcap">R-s-b-ry</span>. <i>Second Piscator</i>, <span class="smcap">H-rc-rt</span>.</p>

<p><i>First Piscator.</i> Oh me, look you, master, a fish, a fish!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Loses it.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Second Piscator.</i> Aye, marry, Sir, that was a good fish; if I had
had the luck to handle that rod, 'tis twenty to one he should
not have broken my line as you suffered him; I would have held
him, as you will learn to do hereafter; for I tell you, scholer, fishing
is an art, or at least it is an art to catch fish. Verily that is the
second brave Salmon you have lost in that pool!</p>

<p><i>First Piscator.</i> Oh me, he has broke all; there's half a line and a
good flie lost. I have no fortune, and that Peers' Pool is fatal fishing.</p>

<p><i>Second Piscator.</i> Marry, brother, so it seemes&mdash;to you at least!
Wel, wel, 'tis as small use crying over lost fish as spilt milk; the
sunne hath sunk, the daye draweth anigh its ende; let us up tackle,
and away!</p>

<p><i>First Piscator.</i> Look also how it begins to rain, and by the clouds
(if I mistake not) we shal presently have a smoaking showre. Truly
it has been a long, rough day, and but poorish sport.</p>

<p><i>Second Piscator.</i> Humph! I am fairly content with <i>my</i> catch,
and had all been landed that have been hookt&mdash;but no matter!
"Fishers must not rangle," as the Angler's song hath it.</p>

<p><i>Second Piscator.</i> Well sung, brother! Oh me, but even at our
peaceful and vertuous pastime, there bee certain contentious and
obstructive spoil-sports now. These abide not good old Anglers'
Law, but bob and splash in other people's swims, fray away the fish
they cannot catch, and desire not that experter anglers should, do
muddy the stream and block its course, do net and poach and foul-hook
in such noisy, conscienceless, unmannerly sort, that even honest
angling becometh a bitter labour and aggravation.</p>

<p><i>First Piscator.</i> Marry, yes brother! the Contemplative Man's Recreation
is verily not what it once was. What would the sweet singer,
Mr. <span class="smcap">William Basse</span>, say to the busy B's of our day; <span class="smcap">Dubartas</span> to
<span class="smcap">B-rtl-y</span>, or Mr. <span class="smcap">Thomas Barker</span>, of pleasant report, to <span class="smcap">Tommy B-wl-s</span>?</p>

<p><i>Second Piscator.</i> Or worthy old <span class="smcap">Cotton</span> to the cocky <span class="smcap">Macullum
More</span>?</p>

<p><i>First Piscator.</i> Or Sir <span class="smcap">Humphrey Davy</span> to the haughty autocrat
of <span class="smcap">H-tf-ld</span>?</p>

<p><i>Second Piscator.</i> Wel, wel, I hate contention and obstruction and

so. But doomed as we often are to angle in different swims, I may
not always land the big fish that you hook, or even&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Second Piscator.</i> Wel, honest scholer, say no more about it, but
let us count and weigh our day's catch. By Jove, but that bigge
one I landed after soe long a fight, and which you were so luckie as
to gaff in that verie snaggy and swirly pool itselfe, maketh a right

<p><i>First Piscator.</i> You say true, master. And indeed the other fish,
though of lesser bigness, bee by no manner of meanes to be sneezed
at. Marry, Master, 'tis none so poor a day's sport after all&mdash;considering
the weather and the much obstruction, eh?</p>

      <span class="i0">Chang, he had a yellow jacket<br /></span>

</div>

<p>How werry particklar sum peeple is in having it adwertised where
they have gone to spend their summer holliday. I wunce saw it
stated, sum years ago, that the Markis of <span class="smcap">Sorlsberry</span> had gone with
the Marchoness to Deep, I think it was, and then follered the
staggering annowncement that Mr. Deputy <span class="smcap">Muggins</span>
and Mrs. <span class="smcap">Muggins</span> was a spending a hole week at
Gravesend! I'm a having mine at Grinnidge, and
had the honner last week of waiting upon the
Ministerial Gents from Westminster, and a werry
jowial lot of Gents they suttenly seems to be.</p>

<p>I likes Grinnidge somehow; it brings back to fond
memmory the appy days when I fust preposed to my
Misses <span class="smcap">Robert</span> in Grinnidge Park, and won from her
blushing lips a fond awowal of her loving detachment
for me!</p>

<p>Ah! them was appy days, them was, and
never cums more than wunce to us; no, not ewen
in Grinnidge Park.</p>

<p>I'm told as how as Appy Amsted is not at all a bad place for this
sort of thing; but I cannot speak from werry much pussonal
xperience there myself.</p>

<p>Having a nour or two to spare before the Westminster Dinner, I
took a strol in the butiful Park. Not quite the place for adwenters,
but I had a little one there on that werry particklar day as I shant
soon forget.</p>

<p>I was a setting down werry cumferal on a nice cumferal seat, when
a nice looking Lady came up to me, and setting herself down beside
me asked me wery quietly if I coud lend her such a thing as harf a
crown! I was that estonished that I ardly knew what to say,
when to my great surprise she bust out a crying, and told me as
how as she had bin robbed, and had not a penny to take her home
to London! What on airth coud I do? I coudn't say as I hadn't
no harf crown coz I had one, and I carnt werry well tell a hunblushing
lie coz I allers blushes if I tries one, so I said as how as it
was the only one as I had, and so I hoped as she woud return it to
me to-morrow, and I told her my adress, when she suddenly threw
her arms round my neck and acshally kist me, and then got up
and ran away! and I have lived ever since in a dredful state of
dowt and unsertenty for fear as she shoud call when I was out
and tell Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robert</span> the hole particklers! and ewen expect her to
believe it!</p>

<p>The successful General, after winning the great victory, acted
with decision. He cut all the telegraph wires with his own hands,
until there was but one left in the camp&mdash;that which had its outlet
in his own tent. He called for the special correspondents.
They came reluctantly, writing
in their note-books as they approached him.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said he, with polite severity,
"I have no wish to deal harshly with the Press.
I am fully aware of the services it does to the
country. But, gentlemen, I have a duty to
perform. I cannot allow you to communicate
to your respective editors the glorious result of
this day's fighting. For a couple of hours you
must be satisfied to restrain your impatience."</p>

<p>"It will yet be in time for the five o'clock
edition," murmured one of the scribes.</p>

<p>"And I shall be able to get it into the
Special," murmured another.</p>

<p>Then the General bowed and retired to his
own tent. At last he was alone. Over the receiver
to the telephone was a board inscribed
with various numbers, with names attached
thereto. He saw that 114 stood for "Wife," 12,017 for "Mother-in-law,"
and 10 for "Junior United Service Club." But he selected
none of these.</p>

<p>"No. 7," he cried, suddenly applying his lips to the receiver and
ringing up, "are you there?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly; what shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Why, buy 30,000 Consols for me," was the prompt reply. And
then the General a few minutes later added, "Have you done it?"</p>

<p>"I have&mdash;for the next account."</p>

<p>And then the warrior smiled and released the Press-men. Nay,
more, he ordered the telegraph wires to be repaired. All was joy
and satisfaction. The glorious news was flashed in a thousand
different directions. The name of the general received immediate
immortality.</p>

<p>And the great commander was more than satisfied. His fortune
was assured. Before allowing the news to be spread abroad he had
taken the precaution to do a preliminary deal with his stockbroker!

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="center">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TORY, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Lords. Monday, August 13.</i>&mdash;Sorry I didn't hear the
Duke of <span class="smcap">Argyll</span>. Have been told he is one of finest orators in House;
a type of the antique; something to be cherished and honoured.</p>

<p>"Were you ever," <span class="smcap">Sark</span> asked, "at Oban when the games were
going on? Very well then, you would see the contest among the
pipers. You have watched them strutting up and down with head
thrown back, toes turned out, cheeks extended, and high notes thrilling
through the shrinking air. There you have Duke of <span class="smcap">Argyll</span>&mdash;God
bless him!&mdash;addressing House of Lords. He is not one piper,
but many. As he proceeds, intoxicated with sound of his own voice,
ecstatic in clearness of his own vision, he competes with himself as
the pipers struggle with each other until at last he has, in a Parliamentary
sense of course, swollen to such a size that there is no room
in the stately chamber for other Peers. Nothing and nobody left but
His Grace the Duke of <span class="smcap">Argyll</span>. Towards end of sixty minutes
spectacle begins to pall on wearied senses; but to begin with, it is
almost sublime. For thirty-two years, he told <span class="smcap">Rosebery</span> just now,
he had sat on the opposite benches, a Member of the Liberal Party.
He sat elsewhere now, but why? Because he was the Liberal Party;
all the rest like sheep had gone astray. Pretty to see the <span class="smcap">Markiss</span>
with blushing head downcast when <span class="smcap">Argyll</span> turned round to him and,
with patronising tone and manner, hailed him and his friends as the
only party with whom a true Liberal might collogue. In some circumstances,
this bearing would be insupportably bumptious. In the
Duke, with the time limit hinted at, it is delightful. He really unfeignedly
believes it all. Sometimes in the dead unhappy night,
when the rain is on the roof (not an uncommon thing in Inverary) he
thinks in sorrow rather than in anger of multitudes of men hopelessly
in the wrong; that is to say, who differ from his view on particular
subjects at given times."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Second Reading of Evicted Tenants Bill moved in
Lords.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;For awhile last night, whilst <span class="smcap">Lansdowne</span> speaking,
<span class="smcap">Clanricarde</span> sat on rear Cross Bench immediately in front of Bar
where mere Commoners are permitted to stand. Amongst them at
this moment were <span class="smcap">Tim Healy</span>, <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>, and <span class="smcap">Sexton</span>, leaning over
rail to catch <span class="smcap">Lansdowne's</span> remarks. Before them, almost within
hand reach, certainly approachable at arm's length with a good
shillalegh, was the bald pate of the man who, from some points of
view, is The Irish Question. <span class="smcap">Clanricarde</span> sat long unconscious of
the proximity. <span class="smcap">Sark</span>, not usually a squeamish person, after breathlessly
watching this strange suggestive contiguity, moved hastily
away. This is a land of law and order. Differences, if they exist,
are settled by judicial processes. But human nature, especially
Celtic nature, is weak. The bald pate rested so conveniently on the
edge of the bench. It was so near; it had schemed so much for the
undoing of hapless friends in Ireland. What if&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>To-night <span class="smcap">Clanricarde</span> instinctively moved away from this
locality. Discovered on back bench below gangway, from which safe
quarter he delivered speech, showing how blessed is the lot of the
light-hearted peasant on what he called "my campaign estates."</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Markiss</span> and <span class="smcap">Clanricarde</span> rose together. It was ten o'clock,
the hour appointed for Leader of Opposition to interpose; in anticipation
of that event the House crowded from floor to side galleries garlanded
with fair ladies. Privy Councillors jostled each other on steps of
Throne; at the Bar stood the Commons closely packed; <span class="smcap">Tim Healy</span>,
anxious not again to be led into temptation, deserted this quarter;
surveyed scene from end of Gallery over the Bar. The <span class="smcap">Markiss</span>
stood for a moment at the table manifestly surprised that any should
question his right to speak. According to Plan of Campaign prepared
beforehand by Whips now was his time; <span class="smcap">Rosebery</span> to follow; and
Division taken so as to clear House before midnight. <span class="smcap">Clanricarde</span>
recks little of Plans of Campaign: stood his ground and finally
evicted the <span class="smcap">Markiss</span>; cast him out by the roadside with no other
compensation than the sympathy of <span class="smcap">Halsbury</span> and of <span class="smcap">Rutland</span>, who
sat on either side of him.</p>

<p>When opportunity came the <span class="smcap">Markiss</span> rose to it. Speech delightful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
to hear; every sentence a lesson in style.
Hard task for young Premier to follow so old
and so perfect a Parliamentary hand. <span class="smcap">Markiss</span>
spoke to enthusiastically friendly audience.
<span class="smcap">Rosebery</span> recognised in himself the representative
of miserable minority of thirty; undaunted,
undismayed, he played lightly with
the ponderous personalities of <span class="smcap">Argyll</span>, and
looking beyond the heads of the crowd of icily
indifferent Peers before him, seemed to see
the multitude in the street, and to hear the
murmur of angry voices.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Lords throw out Evicted
Tenants Bill by 249 votes against 30.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, Midnight.</i>&mdash;Spent restful evening
with Indian Budget. There is nothing
exceeds indignation with which Members resent
postponement of opportunity to consider
Indian Budget, except the unanimity with
which they stop away when it is presented.
Number present during <span class="smcap">Fowler's</span> masterly
exposition not equal to one per ten million of
the population concerned. Later, <span class="smcap">Chaplin</span>
endeavoured to raise drooping spirits by few
remarks on bi-metallism. Success only partial.
<span class="smcap">Clark</span> did much better. Genially
began evening by accusing <span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span>
of humbugging House. That worth at
least a dozen votes to Government in Division
that followed. <span class="smcap">Tim Healy</span>, who can't abear
strong language, was one who meant to vote
against proposal to take remaining time of
Session for Ministers. After <span class="smcap">Clark's</span> speech,
voted with and for the <span class="smcap">Squire</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clark</span> closed pleasant evening by insisting
on Division upon Statute Law Revision Bill
running through Committee.</p>

<p>"Will the hon. Member name a teller,"
said Chairman, blandly.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Conybeare</span>," responded <span class="smcap">Clark</span>, instinctively
thinking of Member for Camborne
as most likely to help in the job he had in
hand.</p>

<p>But <span class="smcap">Conybeare</span> is a reformed character.
Even at his worst must draw line somewhere.
Drew it sharply at <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Appeared as if
game was up. On the contrary it was <span class="smcap">Weir</span>.
Deliberately fixing a pair of cantankerous
pince-nez that seem to be in chronic condition
of strike, <span class="smcap">Weir</span> gazed round angered Committee.
With slowest enunciation in profoundest
chest notes he said, "I will tell with
the hon. Member."</p>

<p>Committee roared with anguished despair;
but, since procedure in case of frivolous and
vexatious Division seems forgotten by Chair,
no help for it. If there are two Members to
"tell," House must be "told." But there
tyranny of two ceases. You may take horse
to water but cannot make him drink.
Similarly you may divide House, but cannot
compel Members to vote with you. Thus it
came to pass that after Division <span class="smcap">Clark</span> and
<span class="smcap">Weir</span> marched up to table with confession
that they had not taken a single man into the
Lobby with them. They had told, but they
had nothing to tell.</p>

<p>"They're worse off by a moiety than the
Squire in the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>," said <span class="smcap">Sark</span>&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

      <span class="i0">The story of Cambuscan bold."<br /></span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"Yes, poor needy Knife-grinders," said the
other <span class="smcap">Squire</span>; "if they'd only thought of it
when asked by the Clerk, 'How many?' they
might have answered, Members, God bless
you, we have none to tell.'"</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Indian Budget through
Committee.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Something notable in question
addressed by <span class="smcap">Bryn Roberts</span> to <span class="smcap">Home Secretary</span>.
Wants to know "whether he is aware
that the Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>, the recently appointed
assistant inspector, who is said to have worked
at an open quarry, never worked at the rock
but simply, when a young man, used to pick
up slabs cast aside by the regular quarrymen,
and split them into slates; and that, <i>ever
since</i>, <i>he has been engaged as a pupil teacher
and a schoolmaster</i>."</p>

<p>Shall put notice on paper to ask <span class="smcap">Bryn
Roberts</span> whether the sequence therein set
forth is usual in Wales, and whether picking
up slabs and splitting them into slates is the
customary pathway to pupil teachership.</p>

<p>Long night in Committee of Supply; fair
progress in spite of <span class="smcap">Weir</span> and <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. <span class="smcap">Tim
Healy</span> sprang ambush on House of Lords:
moved to stop supplies for meeting their household
expenses. Nearly carried proposal, too.
Vote sanctioned by majority of nine, and these
drawn from Opposition.</p>

<p>["The whole care of poultry, the production of

itself a most important branch of commerce&mdash;are
really included within the purposes of this
little institution."&mdash;<i>Mr. Gladstone on "Small
Culture," at the Hawarden Agricultural and
Horticultural Fête, August 14, 1894.</i>]</p></blockquote>
